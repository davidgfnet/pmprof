Poor man's profiler

This is a simple sort of proof-of-concept simple profiler I created to get
a rough idea on what's my program spending time into. It's convenient for
programs and environments that are hard/inconvenient to debug.

It works by ptrace'ing the process and sampling the program counter. For this
reason it is only suitable (or mostly) for programs that use a significant
amount of CPU, otherwise you will just get a lot of libc read/write symbols
where the program sits waiting for I/O.

Just use it like ./profiler PID and Ctrl-C it to get some results.
